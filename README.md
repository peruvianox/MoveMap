# MoveMap

How many people are using thier bodies to move around the built environment? 

This project incorporates webcam live streaming or uploaded videos to log the numbers of walkers and cyclists on a map. By tracking number of walkers and cyclists, we hope to promote higher prevalence of human powered transportation which may improve health among the population as well as shift transportation energy usage towards more sustainable options than typical automobile travel.
